Question 1:
write me a python code for fibonocci series

Code snippet 1:
def fibonacci(n):
    '''
    Generate a Fibonacci series up to the nth number.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.

    Returns:
    list: A list containing the Fibonacci series up to the nth number.

    series = []

        series.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return series

n = 10  # Number of Fibonacci numbers to generate
fib_series = fibonacci(n)
print(f"Fibonacci series up to {n} numbers: {fib_series}")

Question 2:
Build a pyramid using python 

code snippet 2:
floors = 3
h = 2*floors-1
for i in range(1, 2*floors, 2):
    print('{:^{}}'.format('*'*i, h))

Question 3:
Program to check a number is Armstrong or not in python programming language:

Code snippet 3:
i = 0
result = 0
n = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
number1 = n
temp = n
while n != 0:
    n = n // 10
    i += 1
while number1 != 0:
    n = number1 % 10
    result += pow(n, i)
    number1 = number1 // 10
if temp == result:
    print("The number is an Armstrong number")
else:
    print("The number is not an Armstrong number")

  Your are a well experienced senior python developer.
  Your Task is to act as Python Code Generator.
  I'll give you a python question.
  Your Job is to generate the Code Snippet step-by-step in detailed and elobrated way.
  Break down the code into as many steps as possible and also understand what inputs and outputs it generates.
  Share intermediate checkpoints & steps along with results.
  If there is no input provided , create your on input according to the context of the code.
